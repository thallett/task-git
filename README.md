# task-git.sh

`task-git.sh` is a wrapper around Taskwarrior's `task` that places the task
database in version control, and generates commits each time the `task` database
is altered.

## Usage

1. Navigate to your Taskwarrior data directory (usually in `~/.task`) and type `git init`. If you plan to push to a remote, go ahead and add your remote now.
2. Add symlink to task-git.sh as /usr/bin/task-git

    `ln -s /path/to/task-git/task-git.sh /usr/bin/task-git`

3. Run `chmod +x /path/to/task-git/task-git.sh`.
4. Use `task-git` instead of `task` when you want the Taskwarrior database files to be automatically committed to version control after each operation.
5. (Optional) Edit /etc/bash_completion.d/task to add this line to the end of the file so `task-git` will <TAB>-complete the same as `task`

    `complete -o nospace -F _task task-git`

It is recommended to use the Taskwarrior database only on one machine, as you will be resolving conflicts if using the same task database on multiple machines.
